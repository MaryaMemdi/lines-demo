Welcome to My React TypeScript Vite Project!
üöÄ Overview
Dive into the world of modern web development with our cutting-edge project built using React, TypeScript, and Vite! This template serves as a robust foundation for building interactive and high-performance applications, leveraging the latest technologies to enhance your development experience.

üåü Features
Fast Refresh: Enjoy a seamless development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) that keeps your application running smoothly as you make changes.
Type Safety: Harness the power of TypeScript to catch errors early and improve code quality. Our setup is designed to help you write safer, more maintainable code.
ESLint Integration: Keep your code clean and consistent with ESLint rules tailored for React and TypeScript. Our configuration supports type-aware linting to ensure your code adheres to best practices.
üì¶ Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git  
cd your-repo  
npm install  
Then, start the development server:

bash
npm run dev  
Your application will be up and running at http://localhost:3000!

üõ†Ô∏è ESLint Configuration
For those developing production-ready applications, we recommend expanding the ESLint configuration. Here‚Äôs how you can enhance your linting setup:

Configure TypeScript Parser Options: Update your parserOptions to enable type-aware linting:

js
export default tseslint.config({  
  languageOptions: {  
    parserOptions: {  
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],  
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,  
    },  
  },  
});  
Use Type-Checked Configs: Switch to tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked or tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked for stricter rules.

Install ESLint Plugin for React: Add the React plugin to your ESLint configuration:

bash
npm install eslint-plugin-react --save-dev  
Update ESLint Config:

js
// eslint.config.js  
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react';  

export default tseslint.config({  
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },  
  plugins: {  
    react,  
  },  
  rules: {  
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,  
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,  
  },  
});
